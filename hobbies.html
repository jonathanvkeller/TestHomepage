    <h1>No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.</h1>
    <p>He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. Not tricks, Michael, illusions.
        It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. Not tricks, Michael, illusions. We just call it a sausage.</p>
    <p>I'm a monster. Marry me. Guy's a pro. Really? Did nothing cancel? <strong>No… but I'd like to be asked!</strong>
        <em>I'm half machine.</em> I'm a monster.</p>
    <h2>As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch.</h2>
    <p>Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. We just call it a sausage. I
        hear the jury's still out on science. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a
        diet is the best defense.</p>

    <h3>No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an
        honest man with no secrets to hide.</h3>
    <p>No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an
        honest man with no secrets to hide. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. It's called 'taking advantage.'
        It's what gets you ahead in life.</p>

    <p>I've opened a door here that I regret. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. There's only one
        man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor.
    </p>
    <p>I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you
        ahead in life. What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?" Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast
        enough.</p>
    <p>
        Well, what do you expect, mother? I'm afraid I just blue myself. Not tricks, Michael, illusions. He'll want to
        use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. Guy's a pro.
    </p>
    <p>Really? Did nothing cancel? There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. I'm a monster. Now, when you do
        this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. I'm a monster.
    </p>
    <p>First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. I care deeply for nature. Say goodbye to
        these, because it's the last time! What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?"
    </p>
    <p>He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. But I bought a yearbook ad from
        you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? I hear the jury's still out on science. I'm half machine. I'm a
        monster.</p>
    <p>
        I've opened a door here that I regret. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the

        straight?
    </p>
    <p>Guy's a pro. I'm a monster. Guy's a pro. No… but I'd like to be asked! There's only one man I've ever called a
        coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor.
    </p>
    <p>That's why you always leave a note! Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Say goodbye to these, because
        it's the last time! No… but I'd like to be asked! Steve Holt!
