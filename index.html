  <p>Alan Rails, ladies and gentlemen. After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to
    summon ghost trains. It's not all bad though, they were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle.
    Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood. I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks, what about your
    short game? I just wanna die!</p>
  <p>I'm sorry Summer, your opinion means very little to me. I don't get it, and I don't need to. They're not infinite
    universes left in sync with the show. I wish that shotgun was my penis.</p>
  <p>Wow, so your origin is what? You fell into a vat of redundancy? Dont look at me! That guy over there roped me into
    this. That's Right Morty! This is gonna be a lot like that. Except you know. It's gonna make sense. There is no god,
    Summer; gotta rip that band-aid off now you'll thank me later.</p>
  <p>Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you but what people call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels
    animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it.
    Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science. Go home and drink, grandpa. I'm
    not looking for judgement, just a yes or no. Can you assimilate a giraffe? I'm man enough to simply say, 'I'm going
    to poop', and I'd be honored to have Ron Howard involved.</p>
